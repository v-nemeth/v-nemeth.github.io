                        <p>Hi there</p>
                        <p>My name is Viktor Nemeth Andersen, and I am a Software Engineering Student at The University of Southern Denmark</p>
            
                        <p>
                            My motivation in life is to learn as many useful things as i can, and become the best version of myself as i can be. 
                            I find myself able to pickup new things very quickly, apply old knowledge to a new problem, and often come up with ideas to a new project while I'm trying to sleep.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I primarily use Windows at home and Linux at school, since i want to get better at using Linux. 
                            I have also messed with Docker by converting my old Laptop into an ubuntu server. 
                            I am proficient in Java and Python, and have worked with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, during my time at University. 
                            I am taught in several agile methods, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, and know a bit about design patterns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have an interest in new technologies and want to furthen the technological advance in the world. 
                            Creating a new, widely used, technology is a life-long goal of mine.
                        </p>
